Let's say a person got a job offer from a great company with great career prospects in other city\nor other borough of his/her current city. If person accept the job offer then he/she has to shift to new\nlocation. I think a person would love to shift a location which is exactly or almost similar to his/her\nlast location because he/she loves the great amenities and other types of venues that exist in his/her\ncurrent neighbourhood like school, gym, swimming pool, Amusement park, restaurants, coffee-shops,\nspencer etc. So I\u2019ll find out what are borough-neighbourhoods are very similar to give current\nlocation. A person can shift within the city or from one city to another city. If person is shifting within\nthe city then he/she must be changing the borough and my task would be finding neighbourhoods in\nthat borough which are very similar to his/her last location. If a person is shifting from one city to\nanother city then my task would be finding the similar neighbourhoods."
